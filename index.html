        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business AdministrationðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4"><br>My name is Luis Fernando Correa. I am currently a  2nd year Pre-Business student attending the University of California, Riverside. I plan to concentrate in the business marketing field and hope to build a business of my own in the future. My willingness to acquire new knowledge which I can apply to in my future career, as well as my hard-working character is what keeps me concentrated in my educational college career. As a first generation college student it can be overwhelming, but knowing that at the end of this college journey there is a bright future destined for me, is what keeps me working hard every day. Furthermore, seeing the struggles that my parents had to go through as immigrants coming to a completely new country makes me appreciate this college education journey I am pursuing even more. My parents' stories and struggles is what motivates me every day to work hard in life because if they had success coming to a brand new country and speaking a completely different language, then there is no excuse for me not to succeed in this college career that I am pursuing.      <br>

        <br>My hometown is in the city of Ontario in the state of California, which is located right outside in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Growing up I was a very athletic child that enjoyed playing sports at an early age. At just the age of five years old I developed a passion for playing soccer. I played competitive soccer throughout my whole childhood which has contributed to my development of certain values such as discipline, responsibility, and work ethic. I also enjoy watching sports on television such as soccer, basketball and football. My favorite sport teams are F.C. Barcelona and the Lakers. Some of the music that I like to listen to is Spanish music and Hip-Hop. A few of my current favorite artists are Lil Keed, Lil Baby, Lil Durk, NAV, and Future. So far, I have traveled to a couple states in Mexico such as Sonora, Zacatecas, Jalisco and Michoacan to visit my parents' hometown and learn a bit of where they grew up. However, I still have a dream of traveling to Europe and visit Barcelona, Spain and experience what it feels like to watch the F.C. Barcelona soccer team play live at the Camp Nou.      <br>

        <br>Currently I am only studying as a full-time student, but I plan to acquire a part-time job to gain working experience. So far I have developed some experience through working with my father in the construction industry. Working with him has taught me the hard work that is required to earn money. In addition to that, there are a few skills that I have learned from working with my dad such as roofing skills, the architecture and plans that are created beforehand for new projects, and even how to properly utilize tools and machinery. Furthermore, with the wise knowledge and experience that my father has acquired in the construction field together with my current knowledge in the business field, I plan to create a family business in construction.
